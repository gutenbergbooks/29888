<h3><a name = "preface" id = "preface">PREFACE.</a></h3>

<p><span class = "firstword">If</span>&mdash;and the thing is wildly
possible&mdash;the charge of writing nonsense were ever brought against
the author of this brief but instructive poem, it would be based, I feel
convinced, on the line (in p.&nbsp;18)</p>

<p class = "verse">
“Then the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder sometimes.”</p>

<p>In view of this painful possibility, I will not (as I might) appeal
indignantly to my other writings as a proof that I am incapable of such
a deed: I will not (as I might) point to the strong moral purpose of
this poem itself, to the arithmetical principles so cautiously
inculcated in it, or to its noble teachings in Natural History&mdash;I
will take the more prosaic course of simply explaining how it
happened.</p>

<p>The Bellman, who was almost morbidly sensitive about appearances,
used to have the bowsprit unshipped once or twice a week to be
revarnished, and it more than once happened, when the time came for
replacing it, that no one on board could remember which end of the ship
it belonged to. They knew it was not of the slightest use to appeal to
the Bellman about it&mdash;he would only refer to his Naval Code, and
read out in pathetic tones Admiralty Instructions which none of them had
ever
<span class = "pagenum">x</span>
been able to understand&mdash;so it generally ended in its being
fastened on, anyhow, across the rudder. The helmsman<a class = "tag"
name = "tag1" id = "tag1" href = "#note1">*</a> used to stand by with
tears in his eyes: <i>he</i> knew it was all wrong, but alas! Rule 42 of
the Code, “<i>No one shall speak to the Man at the Helm</i>,” had been
completed by the Bellman himself with the words “<i>and the Man at the
Helm shall speak to no one</i>.” So remonstrance was impossible, and no
steering could be done till the next varnishing day. During these
bewildering intervals the ship usually sailed backwards.</p>

<p>As this poem is to some extent connected with the lay of the
Jabberwock, let me take this opportunity of answering a question that
has often been asked me, how to pronounce “slithy toves.” The “i” in
“slithy” is long, as in “writhe”; and “toves” is pronounced so as to
rhyme with “groves.” Again, the first “o” in “borogoves” is pronounced
like the “o” in “borrow.” I have heard people try to give it the sound
of the “o” in “worry.” Such is Human Perversity.</p>

<p>This also seems a fitting occasion to notice the other hard words in
that poem. Humpty-Dumpty’s theory, of two meanings packed into one word
like a portmanteau, seems to me the right explanation for all.</p>

<p>For instance, take the two words “fuming” and “furious.” Make up your
mind that you will say both
<span class = "pagenum">xi</span>
words, but leave it unsettled which you will say first. Now open your
mouth and speak. If your thoughts incline ever so little towards
“fuming,” you will say “fuming-furious;” if they turn, by even a hair’s
breadth, towards “furious,” you will say “furious-fuming;” but if you
have that rarest of gifts, a perfectly balanced mind, you will say
“frumious.”</p>

<p>Supposing that, when Pistol uttered the well-known words&mdash;</p>

<p class = "verse">
“Under which king, Bezonian? Speak or die!”</p>

<p>Justice Shallow had felt certain that it was either William or
Richard, but had not been able to settle which, so that he could not
possibly say either name before the other, can it be doubted that,
rather than die, he would have gasped out “Rilchiam!”</p>

This office was usually undertaken by the Boots, who found in it a
refuge from the Baker’s constant complaints about the insufficient
blacking of his three pair of boots.</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“<span class = "firstword">Just</span> the place for a Snark!” the
Bellman cried,</p>
<p class = "indent">As he landed his crew with care;</p>
<p>Supporting each man on the top of the tide</p>
<p class = "indent">By a finger entwined in his hair.</p>

<p class = "stanza">
“Just the place for a Snark! I have said it twice:</p>
<p class = "indent">That alone should encourage the crew.</p>
<p>Just the place for a Snark! I have said it thrice:</p>
<p class = "indent">What I tell you three times is true.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">4</span>
<p class = "stanza">
The crew was complete: it included a <span class =
"locked">Boots&mdash;</span></p>
<p class = "indent">A maker of Bonnets and <span class =
"locked">Hoods&mdash;</span></p>
<p>A Barrister, brought to arrange their <span class =
"locked">disputes&mdash;</span></p>
<p class = "indent">And a Broker, to value their goods.</p>

<p class = "stanza">
A Billiard-marker, whose skill was immense,</p>
<p class = "indent">Might perhaps have won more than his <span class =
"locked">share&mdash;</span></p>
<p>But a Banker, engaged at enormous expense,</p>
<p class = "indent">Had the whole of their cash in his care.</p>

<p class = "stanza">
There was also a Beaver, that paced on the deck,</p>
<p class = "indent">Or would sit making lace in the bow:</p>
<p>And had often (the Bellman said) saved them from wreck,</p>
<p class = "indent">Though none of the sailors knew how.</p>
</div>

alt = "the ship's crew"></p>

<div class = "verse">
<span class = "pagenum">6</span>
<p class = "stanza">
There was one who was famed for the number of things</p>
<p class = "indent">He forgot when he entered the ship:</p>
<p>His umbrella, his watch, all his jewels and rings,</p>
<p class = "indent">And the clothes he had bought for the trip.</p>

<p class = "stanza">
He had forty-two boxes, all carefully packed,</p>
<p class = "indent">With his name painted clearly on each:</p>
<p>But, since he omitted to mention the fact,</p>
<p class = "indent">They were all left behind on the beach.</p>

<p class = "stanza">
The loss of his clothes hardly mattered, because</p>
<p class = "indent">He had seven coats on when he came,</p>
<p>With three pair of boots&mdash;but the worst of it was,</p>
<p class = "indent">He had wholly forgotten his name.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">7</span>
<p class = "stanza">
He would answer to “Hi!” or to any loud cry,</p>
<p class = "indent">Such as “Fry me!” or “Fritter my wig!”</p>
<p>To “What-you-may-call-um!” or “What-was-his-name!”</p>
<p class = "indent">But especially “Thing-um-a-jig!”</p>

<p class = "stanza">
While, for those who preferred a more forcible word,</p>
<p class = "indent">He had different names from these:</p>
<p>His intimate friends called him “Candle-ends,”</p>
<p class = "indent">And his enemies “Toasted-cheese.”</p>

<p class = "stanza">
“His form is ungainly&mdash;his intellect <span class =
"locked">small&mdash;”</span></p>
<p class = "indent">(So the Bellman would often remark)</p>
<p>“But his courage is perfect! And that, after all,</p>
<p class = "indent">Is the thing that one needs with a Snark.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">8</span>
<p class = "stanza">
He would joke with hyænas, returning their stare</p>
<p class = "indent">With an impudent wag of the head:</p>
<p>And he once went a walk, paw-in-paw, with a bear,</p>
<p class = "indent">“Just to keep up its spirits,” he said.</p>

<p class = "stanza">
He came as a Baker: but owned, when too <span class =
"locked">late&mdash;</span></p>
<p class = "indent">And it drove the poor Bellman half-<span class =
"locked">mad&mdash;</span></p>
<p>He could only bake Bridecake&mdash;for which, I may state,</p>
<p class = "indent">No materials were to be had.</p>

<p class = "stanza">
The last of the crew needs especial remark,</p>
<p class = "indent">Though he looked an incredible dunce:</p>
<p>He had just one idea&mdash;but, that one being “Snark,”</p>
<p class = "indent">The good Bellman engaged him at once.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">9</span>
<p class = "stanza">
He came as a Butcher: but gravely declared,</p>
<p class = "indent">When the ship had been sailing a week,</p>
<p>He could only kill Beavers. The Bellman looked scared,</p>
<p class = "indent">And was almost too frightened to speak:</p>

<p class = "stanza">
But at length he explained, in a tremulous tone,</p>
<p class = "indent">There was only one Beaver on board;</p>
<p>And that was a tame one he had of his own,</p>
<p class = "indent">Whose death would be deeply deplored.</p>

<p class = "stanza">
The Beaver, who happened to hear the remark,</p>
<p class = "indent">Protested, with tears in its eyes,</p>
<p>That not even the rapture of hunting the Snark</p>
<p class = "indent">Could atone for that dismal surprise!</p>
</div>

<span class = "pagenum">10</span>
<p class = "illustration">

alt = "the Butcher and the Beaver"></p>

<div class = "verse">
<span class = "pagenum">11</span>
<p class = "stanza">
It strongly advised that the Butcher should be</p>
<p class = "indent">Conveyed in a separate ship:</p>
<p>But the Bellman declared that would never agree</p>
<p class = "indent">With the plans he had made for the trip:</p>

<p class = "stanza">
Navigation was always a difficult art,</p>
<p class = "indent">Though with only one ship and one bell:</p>
<p>And he feared he must really decline, for his part,</p>
<p class = "indent">Undertaking another as well.</p>

<p class = "stanza">
The Beaver’s best course was, no doubt, to procure</p>
<p class = "indent">A second-hand dagger-proof <span class =
"locked">coat&mdash;</span></p>
<p>So the Baker advised it&mdash;and next, to insure</p>
<p class = "indent">Its life in some Office of note:</p>

<span class = "pagenum">12</span>
<p class = "stanza">
This the Banker suggested, and offered for hire</p>
<p class = "indent">(On moderate terms), or for sale,</p>
<p>Two excellent Policies, one Against Fire,</p>
<p class = "indent">And one Against Damage From Hail.</p>

<p class = "stanza">
Yet still, ever after that sorrowful day,</p>
<p class = "indent">Whenever the Butcher was by,</p>
<p>The Beaver kept looking the opposite way,</p>
<p class = "indent">And appeared unaccountably shy.</p>

<p>Such solemnity, too! One could see he was wise,</p>
<p class = "indent">The moment one looked in his face!</p>

<p class = "stanza">
He had bought a large map representing the sea,</p>
<p class = "indent">Without the least vestige of land:</p>

“What’s the good of Mercator’s North Poles and Equators,</p>

<p class = "indent">He considered the Beaver his friend.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">57</span>
<p class = "stanza">
While the Beaver confessed, with affectionate looks</p>
<p class = "indent">More eloquent even than tears,</p>
<p>It had learned in ten minutes far more than all books</p>
<p class = "indent">Would have taught it in seventy years.</p>

<p class = "stanza">
They returned hand-in-hand, and the Bellman, unmanned</p>
<p class = "indent">(For a moment) with noble emotion,</p>
<p>Said “This amply repays all the wearisome days</p>
<p class = "indent">We have spent on the billowy ocean!”</p>

<p class = "stanza">

<p class = "stanza">
But the Barrister, weary of proving in vain</p>
<p class = "indent">That the Beaver’s lace-making was wrong,</p>
<p>Fell asleep, and in dreams saw the creature quite plain</p>
<p class = "indent">That his fancy had dwelt on so long.</p>

<div class = "verse">
<span class = "pagenum">63</span>
<p class = "stanza">
He dreamed that he stood in a shadowy Court,</p>
<p class = "indent">Where the Snark, with a glass in its eye,</p>
<p>Dressed in gown, bands, and wig, was defending a pig</p>
<p class = "indent">On the charge of deserting its sty.</p>

<p class = "stanza">
The Witnesses proved, without error or flaw,</p>
<p class = "indent">That the sty was deserted when found:</p>
<p>And the Judge kept explaining the state of the law</p>
<p class = "indent">In a soft under-current of sound.</p>

<p class = "stanza">
The indictment had never been clearly expressed,</p>
<p class = "indent">And it seemed that the Snark had begun,</p>
<p>And had spoken three hours, before any one guessed</p>
<p class = "indent">What the pig was supposed to have done.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">64</span>
<p class = "stanza">
The Jury had each formed a different view</p>
<p class = "indent">(Long before the indictment was read),</p>
<p>And they all spoke at once, so that none of them knew</p>
<p class = "indent">One word that the others had said.</p>

<p class = "stanza">
“You must know&mdash;” said the Judge: but the Snark exclaimed
“Fudge!</p>
<p class = "indent">That statute is obsolete quite!</p>
<p>Let me tell you, my friends, the whole question depends</p>
<p class = "indent">On an ancient manorial right.</p>

<p class = "stanza">
“In the matter of Treason the pig would appear</p>
<p class = "indent">To have aided, but scarcely abetted:</p>
<span class = "pagenum">65</span>
<p>While the charge of Insolvency fails, it is clear,</p>
<p class = "indent">If you grant the plea ‘never indebted.’</p>

<p class = "stanza">
“The fact of Desertion I will not dispute:</p>
<p class = "indent">But its guilt, as I trust, is removed</p>
<p>(So far as relates to the costs of this suit)</p>
<p class = "indent">By the Alibi which has been proved.</p>

<p class = "stanza">
“My poor client’s fate now depends on your votes.”</p>
<p class = "indent">Here the speaker sat down in his place,</p>
<p>And directed the Judge to refer to his notes</p>
<p class = "indent">And briefly to sum up the case.</p>

<p class = "stanza">
But the Judge said he never had summed up before;</p>
<p class = "indent">So the Snark undertook it instead,</p>
<span class = "pagenum">66</span>
<p>And summed it so well that it came to far more</p>
<p class = "indent">Than the Witnesses ever had said!</p>

<p class = "stanza">
When the verdict was called for, the Jury declined,</p>
<p class = "indent">As the word was so puzzling to spell;</p>
<p>But they ventured to hope that the Snark wouldn’t mind</p>
<p class = "indent">Undertaking that duty as well.</p>

<p class = "stanza">
So the Snark found the verdict, although, as it owned,</p>
<p class = "indent">It was spent with the toils of the day:</p>
<p>When it said the word “GUILTY!” the Jury all groaned,</p>
<p class = "indent">And some of them fainted away.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">67</span>
<p class = "stanza">
Then the Snark pronounced sentence, the Judge being quite</p>
<p class = "indent">Too nervous to utter a word:</p>
<p>When it rose to its feet, there was silence like night,</p>
<p class = "indent">And the fall of a pin might be heard.</p>

<p class = "stanza">
“Transportation for life” was the sentence it gave,</p>
<p class = "indent">“And <i>then</i> to be fined forty pound.”</p>
<p>The Jury all cheered, though the Judge said he feared</p>
<p class = "indent">That the phrase was not legally sound.</p>

<p class = "stanza">
But their wild exultation was suddenly checked</p>
<p class = "indent">When the jailer informed them, with tears,</p>
<p>Such a sentence would have not the slightest effect,</p>
<p class = "indent">As the pig had been dead for some years.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">68</span>
<p class = "stanza">
The Judge left the Court, looking deeply disgusted:</p>
<p class = "indent">But the Snark, though a little aghast,</p>
<p>As the lawyer to whom the defence was intrusted,</p>
<p class = "indent">Went bellowing on to the last.</p>

<p class = "stanza">
Thus the Barrister dreamed, while the bellowing seemed</p>
<p class = "indent">To grow every moment more clear:</p>
<p>Till he woke to the knell of a furious bell,</p>
<p class = "indent">Which the Bellman rang close at his ear.</p>
